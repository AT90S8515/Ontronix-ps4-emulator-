Hello! 
This is the official Github for Ontronix Ps4 Emulator. 
Made with Python, and Pyguy graphics engine.
--Important_note--
Ontronix is in active development, and most roms won't work, for a while.
At the current moment of 9/5/2019, Ontronix, can run a line of code and then Display an error.
--Tutorial--
When It first starts, Set the first 2 inputs, to validator.json (Even the binary input).
Make sure validator.json, is in the exe's directory.
After that input the location of the rom, you want to run.
The only rom, that can run so far is "test_rom.ps4"
That will change in further updates.
